# Experiments evaluation

This folder contains the scripts used to compute the experiments over a [IMDB database](https://sites.google.com/site/ontopiswc13/home/imdb-mo) represented as an RDF Ontology named *Movie Ontology*.

The mapping file was adapted to our current version of the [RoR] API and we added some complements to the ontology schema, defining the domain and ranges from the properties and adding labels.

To run the experiments only to edit the Source Declaration at the mapping file header adding your own JDBC connection parameters.
